A small example of using markov chains and LSTM networks to model the bible. 
The intent of this project is to show two method of analyzing large texts, such as the entire bible, and discover interesting information about the text, such as word frequencies, most common phrases, and the general 'theme' of a book or author.

This can be extended to other types of writing as well.

This was done on a small dataset and used several Machine Learning Algorithms. This project is a combination of several topics such as Frequency Analysis, Language Modeling and Markov Chains. 
The code can be optimized, but it was very fun to create this.

## Markov Chain Output
```
Such knowledge from heaven. Bulrushes upon me . 9 And thou that go out of the voice of rich. Billows and her hands our fathers of the son nor walk in the congregation ,. Confidences , and it should be forgiven you ? 6 : 20 He that I. Atarah ; for the other saith unto the lilies , and fowls of God before.
Bred worms , and. Antiquity is an inheritance of singing women therein . 13 : of words of a. Resting place to fail , and will go and shall surely he overlaid also shall. Amiss , The sun shineth not good came the door of them , and he. Springeth of man and all the LORD of the beasts of Merari by their families.
Discord . 7 And. Infinite ? tempting him as it in the LORD . 30 For it came and. Leummim . And they , saying , named Zacchaeus , to Gath . 24 And. Thunderings , and in there was two goats for us , and wounded men .. Denied him , Sun , and fear of Israel out of Israel took the LORD.
